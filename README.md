Hi! I'm Iman!

Right now I'm working as a Senior Software Engineer in [Xendit](https://xendit.co), mainly focus on payment, such as Virtual Account, Retail Outlet payment, Ewallet Payment, and Direct Debit payment. I do love solving scaling problem from product perspective. Because I believe no such a silver bullet to help to scale product. And working on product force me to learn and improve myself everytime. I also love to solve engineering problem, like to help the engineers to be able move faster without blocked by manual process.
